// VT100 parser plugin system — pattern-driven prompt handling for
// managed CC sessions.
//
// Replaces the stopgap AUTO_ENTER pump (5s blind \r-spam) with a
// reactive watcher: each plugin owns a sentinel + cursor-position
// predicate, runs against the parser's screen snapshot, and emits an
// Action (write bytes to the PTY, or signal the session to respawn
// without a flag). The watcher fires each plugin at most once per
// session lifetime so a settled prompt doesn't get re-poked.
//
// Built-in plugins live in `builtin.rs`; the framework here is
// plugin-agnostic and unit-testable without a PTY.
